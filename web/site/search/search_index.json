Doesn't require bookmarklets. Doesn't require an install games, nor to install the launcher. Can use elevated chrome permissions. NOTE: The design and style of FoxLauncher is being rapidly prototyped, screenshots may look different to the actual product, functionality should stay the same. Install 1.

This page is dedicated to informing developers on the differences from typical web development. Info What are all these funny file names? .flr : FoxLauncher Resource, a js file .flz : FoxLauncher Zip , a zip file containing a folder of the same name .flc : FoxLauncher Config , an xml file with config data. Creating a .flz An .flz will load provided it contains mostly arbitrary zip data, but for usability its advised it contains a folder named the same thing as the folder. Heres an example example .flz file tree tab-game.zip # zip file \u2514\u2500\u2500 tab-game # index folder \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html # arbitrary contents \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.js \u2514\u2500\u2500 config.flc Creating a .flc A config.flc is searched for when installing an extension, this can be technically stored anywhere, but I advise you to put it in the index folder . A basic config looks like this: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <SETTINGS> <NAME>A Dark Room</NAME> <AUTHOR>Doublespeak Games</AUTHOR> <REQUIREMENTS> <PERM>boykisser</PERM> <PERM>cspinline</PERM> </REQUIREMENTS> </SETTINGS> <!-- GETTING GOOD USE OUT OF THE CAPS LOCK KEY, AREN'T YOU? --> Limits Links, Reloading, and History Basically any page load request that was not initiated by the browser or the user for a page using a filesystem: url will be blocked by chrome. Please see Tab Control . Inline JS When FoxLauncher is launched from an extension it is forced to comply with the extensions CSP policies, this includes many CSPs restriction of unsafe inline . We can use point-blank to get around this, but my personal suggestion is to just put the script in another file when developing for FoxLauncher. With an XML parser someone could make a script to auto covert all html files in a folder to not use unsafe inline, but I don't feel like doing that. Extended Privileges Most extended privileges FoxLaunched sites have can be summed up fairly easily. If FoxLauncher is installed on an extension page, you can then access the same chrome APIs that it has access to. Check here for the list of all chrome APIs. Tab Control Controlling tabs can instead be accessed by the chrome.tabs API. This API is accessible to most extensions and due to the possessive powers of FoxLauncher, if the filesystem is a child of an extension you can access the same control of an extension. You can read the documentation for this API here developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/ .
